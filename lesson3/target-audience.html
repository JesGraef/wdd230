        their business in the town of Rothesay, which includes from small to large businesses 
        in the area. Online business owners are also included to have more ideas and

        audience since everyone encounters with businesses all the time.</p>
    <h2>Personas</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>My first persona are the new entrepreneurs/small business owners that have fairly new 
            business and need help promoting and growing their network. From ages 18-60 are the 
            perfect age group since they know how to use technology and get the information they 
            need online. This group could be with or without educational background, but are 
            excited and eager to do business. This group can come from any culture, 
            single/married/have families. </li>
        <li>The second persona are the medium/large businesses who want to maintain and improve 
            their business, and keep a good reputation/image to their community. This is the 
            group that also wants to give back to their community. This can be any age from 
            18-60, single/married/family, also with or without education but are passionate in 
            doing business. This group should also be tech-savvy and know to use any type of 
            technology.
